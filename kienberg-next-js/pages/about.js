            Kienberg Athletic's home stadium, Waldeckpark, is a special place
            for both our players and fans alike. With a seating capacity of
            1000, it provides an intimate atmosphere that allows our supporters
            to feel closely connected to the game. But it's not just a place for
            matches â€“ Waldeckpark is also used as a training ground for both our
            main team and our U-19 team. This allows us to develop our players'
            skills in a familiar environment, and ensures that they are always
            in top shape for game day. We take great pride in our stadium, and
            we believe that it's one of the key factors that makes Kienberg
            Athletic such a special club.
